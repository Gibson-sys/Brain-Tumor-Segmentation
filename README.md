Tumor Segmentation Project

This project focuses on using deep learning techniques, specifically the U-Net model, to segment tumor regions in MRI images. The goal is to accurately localize and differentiate tumor areas from healthy tissues, aiding in medical diagnosis and treatment planning. The model is trained on MRI datasets using tumor masks as ground truth, ensuring precise segmentation. Performance is evaluated based on metrics like Dice Coefficient, and accuracy. This research contributes to improving automated tumor detection, reducing human error, and enhancing efficiency in medical imaging analysis. ðŸš€
